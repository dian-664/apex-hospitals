                <h2>About the Department</h2>
                <p>The department was established in 1990, during the period in which severe and rampant cases of malaria were discovered in the area after the unfortunate and tragic death of many newborn babies in the region. The hospital was already established but lacked professionals in the field of pediatrics that led to the birth of the department.</p>

                <h3>History of the Department</h3>
                <p>The department started with only two members who were missionary professors, proud graduates of Cambridge University. Since its inception the department has been a place of inspiration to the young women and kids out here, not only in the community but also in the surrounding areas as well.</p>
